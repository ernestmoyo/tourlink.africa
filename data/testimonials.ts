      'TourLink pieced together our Serengeti–Zanzibar honeymoon so seamlessly that every transfer, lodge, and game drive felt like it had been rehearsed. Watching a leopard haul its kill into an acacia at sunset, then landing on a Zanzibar sandbar two days later, was the contrast of a lifetime. We have already booked our anniversary trip back through them.',

      'I trained for months, but the mountain still humbled me — and TourLink made sure I had the right operator to get me through it. The Altezza crew they partnered with was world-class: hot meals at every camp, a medic checking oxygen levels twice daily, and a summit-night guide who simply refused to let me quit. Standing on Uhuru Peak at sunrise was the greatest moment of my life.',

    quote:
      'As a South African I thought I knew my own backyard, but TourLink introduced me to a side of the Kruger I had never experienced — private concession game drives, bush dinners under the stars, and a guide who could identify birds by their alarm calls. The Cape Town leg was equally polished, from a sunrise Table Mountain hike to a private wine-blending session in Franschhoek.',

    quote:
      'We wanted the highlights of Southern and East Africa in ten days without the stress of self-drive logistics, and TourLink delivered exactly that. From sundowners on Camps Bay beach to a helicopter flip over Victoria Falls, every day topped the last. Their local partners knew every back road and sunset viewpoint — it felt like travelling with well-connected friends.',

      'Bazaruto exceeded every expectation. TourLink arranged a dhow sailing trip to a private sandbar where we snorkelled with sea turtles and ate freshly grilled prawns on the beach. The barefoot luxury lodge felt like our own private island. If you want Indian Ocean magic without the Maldives price tag and with far more character, this is it.',
